# GOT Information Page and JavaScript Animation Assignment

This is a page made to display information and video files for the main Houses featured in the HBO series, Game of Thrones. Upon clicking a house's sigil, their banner will scroll into view as the House Name and House Description is changed below the banner. Once the animation is complete, a lightbox is triggered to open, at which point an informational video about the chosen House is shown. To see the video controls, simply hover over the video player. You can click 3 buttons - 'close' which closes the lightbox, 'pause' which pauses the video, or 'rewind' which will start it again from the beginning. Clicking 'pause' will change the button to be 'play' instead, so you can continue the video as you wish. Once the video is complete, the lightbox will close, leaving you able to check out the other Houses as you wish.
